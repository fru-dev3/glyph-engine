// Specialists: a method that works in any domain. Domain expertise stays in
// the domain's own files, so the roster never multiplies by domain.
//
// A specialist file (built in below, or the user's own in
// build/specialists/<id>.md, same shape) is frontmatter plus three sections:
//
//   ---
//   id: researcher
//   name: Researcher
//   icon: search
//   family: know            # know | decide | do | grow | deliver
//   returns: findings
//   ceiling: read           # read | write-vault | draft | act-ask | act
//   tools: [web, vault-read]
//   apps: []
//   runtime: deep
//   lens: off
//   budget: { minutes: 10, usd: 0.50, passes: 3 }
//   handoff: offer          # off | offer | auto
//   done_when:
//     - every claim has a source
//   ---
//   ## Mandate
//   ## Method
//   ## Never
//
// Per domain, the user's instructions live in
// data/domains/<d>/source/specialists/<id>.md (they may only TIGHTEN: a lower
// ceiling, fewer tools or apps, never more), and the specialist's notebook
// (what it learned there, AI-maintained, short) in
// data/domains/<d>/memory/specialists/<id>.md.
//
// Ceilings are enforced in code (jobs.ts): in this phase no specialist runs
// with tools that act; a write-vault result is written by code into the
// domain it was sent to, a draft is stored and never sent.
