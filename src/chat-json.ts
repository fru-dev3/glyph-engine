// chat-json — the `prevail chat --domain X --json` handler.
//
// Runs a single chat turn in a domain and emits an NDJSON stream of
// ChatEvent objects (docs/schemas/ChatEvent.json) — one JSON object per
// line, flushed as it happens. Typical order:
//
//   start → (delta*) → assistant → usage → done → (touched)
//
// `touched` comes after `done`, just before the process exits: the reply is
// never held up for it. It says which other domains and which of the user's
// own entities the exchange also concerns (linking.ts), and is absent when
// nothing was touched, the step was skipped, or it ran past its deadline.
//
// On failure it emits a single `error` event (and still exits non-zero).
//
// This is the machine-facing twin of the interactive chat pane. It reuses
// the existing cli-bridge `runChatTurn` streaming path (onChunk → delta
// events) so the engine behavior is identical to the TUI. The finalized turn
// (user + assistant) is persisted append-only to the JSONL source-of-truth at
// <vault>/<domain>/_threads/<sessionId>.jsonl via session.ts, and mirrored
// into the rebuildable SQLite/FTS index — keeping JSONL canonical and the
// .db a regenerable cache (VAULT-SPEC §4).
