// playwright-resolve — robust runtime resolution of playwright-core for the
// COMPILED single-file binary.
//
// THE BUG (#6): the engine is built with `bun build --compile`, which bakes
// playwright-core into the binary's virtual filesystem (/$bunfs/root/prevail).
// At runtime, playwright-core's own internals resolve their package.json /
// browser registry relative to the BUILD-TIME node_modules path
// (".../engine/node_modules/playwright-core/package.json"), which does not
// exist on the user's machine and is not present inside /$bunfs. So a plain
// `import("playwright-core")` inside the packaged binary throws:
//   "playwright-core unavailable: Cannot find module
//    '.../engine/node_modules/playwright-core/package.json' from '/$bunfs/root/prevail'".
//
// THE FIX: do NOT rely on the in-binary copy. Resolve a REAL on-disk
// playwright-core that is shipped alongside the executable (the sidecar layout)
// and import it from that absolute path. The release build copies
// node_modules/playwright-core into dist/ next to the binary, and the desktop
// app ships the same folder as a sidecar resource. Resolution order:
//   1. PREVAIL_PLAYWRIGHT_CORE env override (desktop points at its sidecar).
//   2. node_modules/playwright-core next to the executable (and ../, Resources/,
//      resources/ for macOS .app / packaged layouts).
//   3. The repo node_modules (dev: running from source under `bun`).
//   4. Last resort: the bundled `import("playwright-core")` (works only when the
//      build managed to bundle it cleanly, e.g. some dev/test contexts).
//
// Importing the on-disk copy by ABSOLUTE PATH sidesteps the broken in-binary
// resolution entirely, because the loaded module's __dirname/import.meta.dir
// then point at the real folder that owns its package.json and lib/ bundles.
