// stream as `chat --json`, so the desktop reuses its existing stream parser
// unchanged. The harness runs its own internal tool/agent loop; this module only
//   1. gates the goal through the autonomy broker (broker.ts),
//   2. frames the goal into an agent prompt,
//   3. runs one turn via runChatTurn (act = the broker's auto decision),
//   4. streams deltas + a final assistant/usage/done, and
//   5. persists a transcript to <vault>/<domain>/_agent_sessions/<id>.jsonl.
//
// The result sink for a task (appending a comment, bumping status) lives on the
// desktop side, which already owns task_detail_add_comment / tasks_set_status.
