# Third-Party Notices

Glyph Engine (the `prevail` CLI) is distributed under GPL-3.0-only.
It bundles or depends on the third-party components below, each under its own
license, reproduced/attributed here as those licenses require. This file
satisfies the attribution obligations of the MIT/ISC/Apache-2.0 components we
redistribute (notably playwright-core, whose Apache-2.0 NOTICE and
ThirdPartyNotices.txt ship inside the app bundle).

## Bundled at distribution time

- **playwright-core** — Apache-2.0 — Microsoft — bundled into the shipped app; see node_modules/playwright-core/NOTICE and ThirdPartyNotices.txt
- **react** — MIT — Meta
- **@opentui/core** — MIT — OpenTUI authors

## Full dependency set

The complete, resolved dependency tree and each package's license text are
available from the lockfile (`package-lock.json` / `bun.lock`) and under
`node_modules/<pkg>/LICENSE` after install. Run `npx license-checker --summary`
(or `bunx license-checker`) to regenerate a full inventory. No dependency is
under a license incompatible with GPL-3.0 distribution.
